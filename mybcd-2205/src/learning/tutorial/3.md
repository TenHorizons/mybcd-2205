#Tutorial -3

##Question:

1.	What is hashing algorithm?  

2.	Demonstrate the password hashing using SHA algorithms.

	Hashing algorithm:
    Algorithms: MD5, SHA family
    Technical aspect in working up hashing functions with MD5 or SHA family
    SecureRandom class in order to generate salt value (random value)
	
	Hashing is always used in password. We practise to store the hash of password in Data store.

	1) We will walk through a demo of how-to hashing function with specified algorithm.
		 Generate the salt value using securerandom class
    	 Example: Password storage method- salt value
         1) Prepend the salt to the password value
         2) Append the salt to the password value
    		Eg., 
    		1) Password: "123"; Salt: "8ua8sduas8ud"
               What to be hashed? "8ua8sduas8ud123", it then being hashed....
        	2) Password: "123"; Salt: "8ua8sduas8ud"
            	//What to be hashed? "1238ua8sduas8ud", it then being hashed....
        
    
	2) Explain a project sample (password)
